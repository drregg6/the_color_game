# the_color_game
Guess the correct color!

Recommended from Udemy's The Web Developer Bootcamp from Colt Steele

When the user starts a new game, six divs will randomly generate to different colors<br>
The user will select which color they think corresponds to one of the given RGB() codes at the top of the game<br>
If the user guesses incorrectly, the div disappears and the user tries again<br>
If the user guesses correctly, all divs change to the winning color!
